# (Prosper Loan data exploration)
## by (Osayande Ebowe)


## Dataset

This project explores a dataset with loan data of approximately 113,937 loans consisting of 81 features. 
The main features i explored in the data consisted of Borrowers' information and loan information


## Summary of Findings

The purpose of this analysis was to explore and understand the factors influencing loan performance and borrower behavior within the Prosper loan dataset. By examining a range of loan attributes, including loan amount, borrower income, credit ratings, debt-to-income ratio, and loan outcomes, we aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform risk assessment, lending strategies, and portfolio management.

Through rigorous exploratory data analysis (EDA), we investigated distributions, correlations, and anomalies across key variables, identifying both opportunities and risks. Statistical summaries and visualizations were used to highlight trends in borrower demographics, loan term preferences, and repayment behavior. Particular attention was given to identifying factors contributing to defaults and late payments, enabling data-driven insights into credit risk and profitability.

This analysis provides a foundation for evidence-based decision-making, equipping business leaders, risk managers, and operational teams with actionable insights to optimize loan offerings, mitigate risk, and enhance overall portfolio performance.
## COnclusion

The analysis revealed several significant insights into borrower behavior and loan outcomes. Key observations include:

Loan Amount and Borrower Income: Higher-income borrowers tend to take larger loans and demonstrate lower default rates, suggesting income is a strong predictor of repayment capacity.

Credit Ratings and Loan Performance: Borrowers with higher Prosper ratings are less likely to default, confirming the predictive power of credit scoring in assessing risk.

Loan Term Implications: Longer-term loans exhibit slightly higher default probabilities, highlighting the importance of aligning loan term offerings with borrower risk profiles.

Debt-to-Income Ratio: Borrowers with elevated debt-to-income ratios are more prone to late payments or defaults, emphasizing the importance of evaluating overall financial obligations.

Overall, the insights generated from this analysis provide a strategic perspective on lending risk and portfolio optimization. By leveraging these findings, stakeholders can refine loan approval criteria, improve borrower targeting, and implement more effective risk management strategies, ultimately enhancing profitability and minimizing exposure to default.
